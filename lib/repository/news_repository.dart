Companies such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook are under scrutiny for their market dominance and alleged anti-competitive practices. The investigation comes amidst growing concerns about the power these companies wield over the digital economy and their impact on competition.

As the investigation unfolds, tech giants are gearing up for a protracted legal battle that could reshape the competitive landscape of the digital economy.

    title: 'Global Markets Volatile as Trade Tensions Escalate',
    article: '''Global financial markets were rattled today as trade tensions between the United States and China escalated, with both countries imposing new tariffs on each other's goods. The tit-for-tat trade war has sent shockwaves through the global economy, leading to increased uncertainty and volatility in financial markets. Investors are bracing for a prolonged period of instability as the world's two largest economies engage in a bitter trade dispute.

The latest round of tariffs comes after months of failed negotiations between the US and China, with both sides blaming each other for the breakdown in talks.

Economists warn that the trade tensions could slow global economic growth and lead to a broader downturn in the coming months.

Amidst the escalating trade tensions, investors are seeking safe-haven assets such as gold and government bonds to hedge against market volatility. The uncertainty surrounding the trade war has also led to increased demand for defensive stocks, as investors look to protect their portfolios from potential losses. With no end in sight to the trade dispute, global markets are bracing for a turbulent period ahead as the US and China continue to spar over trade policy.''',
